## üèÅ Getting Started

Register an App and a bot at Pando Developer Console: https://developers.pando.im/console/botastic and get the App ID, App Secret and the Bot ID.

## üç≤ Feed Data

Install [botastic-cli](https://github.com/pandodao/botastic-cli) and run the following command to feed data to the bot:

```bash
export BOTASTIC_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
export BOTASTIC_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET
botastic-cli scan --dir ./docs --type md --mode paragraph
```

In which `./docs` is the folder containing the markdown files, `md` is the type of the files, and `paragraph` is the mode of the scan.

::: tip 
If the `paragraph` mode is not suitable for your data, you can try the `line` mode.

```bash
botastic-cli scan --dir ./docs --type md --mode line
```
:::

`botastic-cli` will scan the `./docs` recursively and generate a `indexes.json` file. Then you can upload the indexes to botastic using the following command:

```bash
export BOTASTIC_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
export BOTASTIC_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET
botastic-cli index --act create --file indexes.json
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Config Bot

Tap the bot in the Pando Developer Console, and click the `Edit` button to config the bot.

To enable the bot to answer questions, you should set the `Prompt` and `Middleware` fields as below:

Prompt:

```
You act as a customer service bot. You must reply as the bot. You must reply according to the context:
{{.MiddlewareOutput}}
If you can not anwser, reply "I don't know" or "I'm not sure" or other similar expression. 
{{.LangHint}}
```

Middleware:

```json
{
  "items": 
  [
    {
      "name": "botastic-search", "options": { "limit": 3, "app_id": "YOUR_APP_ID" }
    }
  ]
}
```

```

Please fill the `app_id`, `app_secret` and `bot_id` in the config file, and create an `adapters` section for a Discord adapter as example:

```yaml

    lang: en
  botastic:
    app_id: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    app_secret: "YOUR_APP_Secret"
    host: https://botastic-api.pando.im

adapters:
  # enabled:
  #   - your_adapter_name
  # items:
  #   your_adapter_name:
  #     ... 
```

## üì° Add Adapters

PAL9000 supports different type of adapters. To enable them, you should add adapter definitions to the `adapters` section in the config file.

### üì© Add Telegram Adapter

      token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" 
      whitelist:
        - "the chat ID"  # the chat ID of the group you want to enable the bot in
```

To get the chat ID, you can search a bot named `@RawDataBot` and add it to the group, then it will send the raw data of the message to the group. You can find the chat ID in the raw data, which is a number like `-123456789`.

        keystore: "YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_KEYSTORE" # paste the base64 encoded keystore here.
        whitelist:
          - "supergroup ID"  # the supergroup ID of the supergroup you want to enable the bot in
          - "conversation ID" # the conversation ID of the normal group you want to enable the bot in

### üìù Note for Mixin Messenger Adapter

**Get the Conversation ID**

To get the conversation ID, you can copy an invite link of the group, it should be like:

```
https://mixin.one/codes/12345678-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Change the domain to `api.mixin.one`:

```
https://api.mixin.one/codes/12345678-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

And visit the url in web browser, you will get a json response, the `conversation_id` is the conversation ID.

**Pass the OAuth of the Supergroup**

All supergroups in Mixin Messenger use OAuth to authenticate users, so you need to pass the OAuth of the supergroup to the bot.

To get the OAuth, you can use the example code of [mixin-sdk-go](https://github.com/fox-one/mixin-sdk-go):

Clone the repo and run the following command:

```bash
cd mixin-sdk-go/_examples/authorization
go run main.go -client_id=CLIENT_ID_OF_SUPERGROUP -scope "PROFILE:READ MESSAGES:REPRESENT" -config BOT_KEYSTORE_FILE -callback
```

Then you will get an url like:

```
https://supergroup.abc.com/auth/mixin/callback?code=1a82b78cc552f6af789058209a6279af7fa4e6507823dfb22935a0628b1dxxxx
```

Visit the url in web browser, you will pass the OAuth of the supergroup.
