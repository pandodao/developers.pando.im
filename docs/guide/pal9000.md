## 🏁 Getting Started

Register an App and a bot at Pando Developer Console: https://developers.pando.im/console/botastic and get the App ID, App Secret and the Bot ID.

## 🍲 Feed Data

Install [botastic-cli](https://github.com/pandodao/botastic-cli) and run the following command to feed data to the bot:

```bash
export BOTASTIC_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
export BOTASTIC_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET
botastic-cli scan --dir ./docs --type md --mode paragraph
```

In which `./docs` is the folder containing the markdown files, `md` is the type of the files, and `paragraph` is the mode of the scan.

`botastic-cli` will scan the `./docs` recursively and generate a `indexes.json` file. Then you can upload the indexes to botastic using the following command:

```bash
export BOTASTIC_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
export BOTASTIC_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET
botastic-cli index --act create --file indexes.json
```

<!-- Install PAL9000 -->
## 📦 Install PAL9000

## 📝 Generate Config File

Run the following command to generate an example config file:

```bash
PAL9000 config -e > config.yaml
```

Please fill the `app_id`, `app_secret` and `bot_id` in the config file, and create an `adapters` section for a Discord adapter as example:

```yaml

  bot:
    bot_id: YOUR_BOT_ID
    lang: en
  botastic:
    app_id: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    host: https://botastic-api.pando.im
    debug: false
adaptors:
  # enabled:
  #   - your_adapter_name
  # items:
  #   your_adapter_name:
  #     ... 
```

In which, `YOUR_BOT_ID` and `YOUR_APP_ID` is the Bot ID and App ID you got from Pando Developer Console.

## 🏃 Run PAL9000

Use the following command to run PAL9000:

```bash
PAL9000 run --config config.yaml
```

PAL9000 will exit immediately because there is no adapter enabled by default.

## 📡 Add Adapters

PAL9000 supports different type of adapters. To enable them, you should add adapter definitions to the `adaptors` section in the config file.

### 📩 Add Telegram Adapter

Search `@BotFather` on Telegram, and tpye `/newbot` to create a new bot. @BotFather will ask you to set a name and a username for the bot. After that, you will get a token for the bot. Copy the token for the next step.

      token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" 
      whitelist:
        - "the chat ID"  # the chat ID of the group you want to enable the bot in
```

**Get the Conversation ID**

To get the conversation ID, you can copy an invite link of the group, it should be like:

```
https://mixin.one/codes/12345678-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Change the domain to `api.mixin.one`:

```
https://api.mixin.one/codes/12345678-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

And visit the url in web browser, you will get a json response, the `conversation_id` is the conversation ID.

**Pass the OAuth of the Supergroup**

All supergroups in Mixin Messenger use OAuth to authenticate users, so you need to pass the OAuth of the supergroup to the bot.

To get the OAuth, you can use the example code of [mixin-sdk-go](https://github.com/fox-one/mixin-sdk-go):

Clone the repo and run the following command:

```bash
cd mixin-sdk-go/_examples/authorization
go run main.go -client_id=CLIENT_ID_OF_SUPERGROUP -scope "PROFILE:READ MESSAGES:REPRESENT" -config BOT_KEYSTORE_FILE -callback
```

Then you will get an url like:

```
https://supergroup.abc.com/auth/mixin/callback?code=1a82b78cc552f6af789058209a6279af7fa4e6507823dfb22935a0628b1dxxxx
```

Visit the url in web browser, you will pass the OAuth of the supergroup.
