It obviates the need for single Mixin Dapp, prioritizing decentralization, censorship resistance, and security.</p><p>Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.</p><p>Pairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the “constant product” formula is preserved. This formula, most simply expressed as <strong>x * y = k</strong>, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pair’s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.</p><blockquote><p>4swap/Pando Lake is a MTG implementation on Mixin Network of Uniswap V2</p><p>A modified <a href="https://curve.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Curve</a> formula used on the stablecoin pools like USDT/USDC.</p></blockquote><h2 id="interact-with-4swap" tabindex="-1">Interact with 4swap <a class="header-anchor" href="#interact-with-4swap" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>All participants of 4swap complete the interaction by transferring tokens to the multisig wallet.
